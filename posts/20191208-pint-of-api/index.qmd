summary: Understand the fundamentals of APIs with this adaptation of a short talk I gave fully in-editor with Visual Studio Code.

## Definition

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In other words, it's an _interface_ that makes it easier for developers to _program_ different _applications_.

## Some examples

- Twitter
- Booking.com
- Your computer's file system

## RESTful APIs

These are APIs that follow the REST architectural style. REST stands for __REpresentational State Transfer__, and it makes it easier for systems to communicate between one another. By using a REST interface, different clients can hit the same endpoints and perform the same actions to obtain the same responses.

Therefore, the code that implements the server and the one that implements the client can be developed independently and without previous knowledge of each other. Changes to these codebases can be performed at any time without affecting the other codebase, as long as each side knows what format to expect in the data.

Systems following this architectural paradigm are stateless, which means that the server and the client do not need to know anything about the state of their counterpart. This is enforced with the use of resources, which are any object, document, or element of the Web. REST systems interact through standard operations on these resources.

## Communication

In the REST architecture, the client sends a request that retrieves or modifies a given resource, and the server sends a response to the request.

### Requests

A request generally consists of:

- an HTTP verb defining the operation to perform
- a _header_, containing metadata about the request
- a path to a resource, also called an _endpoint_
- an optional message body with a data payload

#### HTTP verbs

The basic verbs to interact with resources over HTTP are:

- GET — to retrieve a resource or collection of resources
- POST — to create a new resource
- PUT — to update a resource
- DELETE — can you guess?

#### Endpoints

An endpoint is a path that points to a resource. These are normally hierarchical and tend to be quite descriptive, so that the client can understand what resource they are accessing even if they have never seen that specifiv path before.

For example, take [https://api.github.com/users/gonz4lex/repos](https://api.github.com/users/gonz4lex/repos). This points to the _repos_ endpoint, which stores information about the repositories of the user with the name _gonz4lex_ (that's me!), and is used, for instance, in a GET request to retrieve information about the specific resource. 

### Responses

Responses from the server generally contain the data payload requested by the client as well as response metadata, such as status code and content type.

#### Response codes

Responses contain information of the success status of the operation, to inform the client of its success (or failure). There are many such codes, but it's only important to know the most common ones and learn how they can be used.

| Status code                   | Meaning                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200 (OK)`                    | Succesful standard HTTP request.                                         |
| `201 (CREATED)`               | Succesful request that results in the creation of an item.               |
| `204 (NO CONTENT)`            | Succesful request that returns an empty response body.                   |
| `400 (BAD REQUEST)`           | Unsuccesful request due to client error such as bad syntax               |
| `403 (FORBIDDEN)`             | Unsuccesful request due to lack of authentication or credentials.        |
| `404 (NOT FOUND)`             | Unsuccesful request because the resource could not be found.             |
| `500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)` | Generic response to unexpected failure when no futher info is available. |
